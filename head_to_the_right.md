You turn to the right, the silhouette of the bridge growing clearer with each cautious step. The wooden planks feel uneven under your feet, and a faint chill rises from the rushing water below. As you near the middle of the bridge, the eerie quiet is broken by an unexpected sound—a faint, melodic hum. It sends a shiver down your spine, its rhythm hypnotic yet unsettling, as if the sound itself is alive.

You grip the railing tightly, torn between pressing on and turning back. The hum grows louder, and suddenly, you catch a glimpse of movement on the far side of the bridge—a flicker of light, just out of reach. Your breath catches as the flicker of light intensifies, revealing a faint, glowing figure shrouded in mist. The melodic hum seems to emanate from it, beckoning you forward, yet every instinct screams to stay away.

What is next step?
