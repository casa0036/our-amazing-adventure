## You've decided to head forward (looks like you like some mystery in your life)

you decide to head forward into the dense fog, guided only by instinct and a faint sense of curiosity. 

Each step feels heavier as the air grows colder and the shadows around you shift unnervingly. The ground beneath your feet turns uneven, and in the distance, you hear a faint, rhythmic soundâ€”like a distant drumbeat or a heart pounding in the silence. Suddenly, you see an old, dilapidated building emerge from the mist, its doors slightly ajar. 

Do you enter the building to investigate the source of the sound, or do you retreat?
