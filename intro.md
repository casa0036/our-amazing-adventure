## Our Amazing Story

You hear a concerning noise coming from your car as your driving along a dark and foggy road. **Klunk** Your car start's pouring out smoke before it comes to a dead stop. You look down at your phone and see a blank screen. It's dead. The sun has already gone down and looking around all you see is pitch black as far as you can see. To the left is a wall of trees and off in the distance looks to be a light, turing to the right you see what looks to be bridge.
