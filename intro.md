## Our Amazing Story

You hear a concerning noise coming from your car as your driving along a dark and foggy road. **Klunk** Your car start's pouring out smoke before it comes to a dead stop. You look down at your phone and see a blank screen. It's dead. The sun has already gone down and looking around all you see is pitch black as far as you can see. To the left is a wall of trees and off in the distance looks to be a light, turing to the right you see what looks to be bridge.

You hold your breath, trying to steady your racing heart. The voices are growing louder, and you can make out a few words—something about a "plan" and "tonight." The urgency in their voices sends a chill down your spine. You crouch down behind a thick bush, trying to stay hidden as you peer through the leaves. The figures come into view—two men, standing by a small fire. Their faces are shadowed, but you can tell they're watching the path ahead, unaware of your presence.
